# Project Starter

Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to add these files to new projects.

```
$ npm install -g degit
$ degit j127/project_starter
```

If there are files in the directory, you can use `--force`, but it might overwrite existing files.

This file is in `.github/README.markdown` so that it won't overwrite existing `README.md` files in a project. The `.gitignore` file also has an alternate name to avoid overwriting the original one.
